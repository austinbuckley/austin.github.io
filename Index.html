 <h2> About me </h2> 
 <p> I was born on April 6th, 2001 in New Hampshire. I have lived <br>
     in Walpole, NH my entire life. Walpole is a small town about <br>
     ~15 miles from Keene. I decided to go to Keene State because <br>
     I got decent scholarships, it was in state, and I could easily <br>
     commute from home. All of this combined will keep the cost <br>
     of college to a minimum.
